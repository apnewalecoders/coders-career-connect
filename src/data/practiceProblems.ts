    title: "Two Sum",
    description: `Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Constraints:
• 2 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁴
• -10⁹ ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁹
• -10⁹ ≤ target ≤ 10⁹
• Only one valid answer exists.

Input Format:
The first line contains the number of elements n.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the array.
The third line contains the target integer.

Output Format:
Return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.`,

    title: "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters",
    description: `Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Constraints:
• 0 ≤ s.length ≤ 5 * 10⁴
• s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

Input Format:
A single line containing the string s.

Output Format:
Return the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.`,
